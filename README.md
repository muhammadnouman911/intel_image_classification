# 🌄 Intel Image Classification

This project performs image classification on the Intel Image Classification dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained to classify images into various categories like buildings, forests, mountains, seas, streets, and glaciers.
